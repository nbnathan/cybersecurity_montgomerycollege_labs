Lab: Hashcat – Perform Straight Attack
Instructor: Prof. David Vargas

This lab was completed as part of the Cybersecurity Associate Degree at Montgomery College and reflects hands-on experience with offline password cracking techniques commonly used in security assessments and incident response contexts.

Lab Objective
-	Execute a straight (dictionary) attack using Hashcat
-	Identify and apply the correct hash mode for MD5
-	Evaluate the effectiveness of dictionary-based attacks against unsalted hashes

What I Practiced
-	Configured and executed Hashcat in straight attack mode (-a 0)
-	Analyzed target hashes and selected the appropriate hash type (-m 0, MD5)
-	Leveraged the rockyou.txt wordlist to recover weak credentials
-	Interpreted Hashcat execution output, including recovery rates and attack status
-	Validated cracked credentials via output files and potfile lookup using --show

Tools Used
-	Hashcat
-	Kali Linux
-	VirtualBox
-	Terminal

Outcome
- Successfully recovered 7 out of 13 password hashes using a dictionary attack
- Confirmed results through Hashcat output and potfile verification
