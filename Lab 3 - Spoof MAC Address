Lab: Linux – Spoof MAC Address
Instructor: Prof. David Vargas

This lab was completed as part of the Cybersecurity Associate Degree at Montgomery College and reflects hands-on experience with Linux network interface manipulation and identity obfuscation techniques relevant to security assessments, privacy, and adversarial behavior analysis.

Lab Objective
-	Identify the MAC address of a network interface using modern Linux networking tools
-	Modify (spoof) a MAC address via the command-line interface
-	Validate MAC address changes and understand operational limitations

What I Practiced
-	Used the ip command from the iproute2 suite to manage network interfaces
-	Identified active network interfaces and their associated MAC addresses
-	Disabled and re-enabled a network interface to apply configuration changes
-	Spoofed a MAC address at the operating system level using CLI commands
-	Verified successful MAC address changes through interface inspection
-	Restored the network interface to its original MAC address

Tools Used
- VirtualBox
- Kali Linux
- Terminal
- iproute2 (ip command)


Outcome
- Successfully spoofed the MAC address of a Linux Ethernet interface
- Verified the MAC address change using ip link show
- Demonstrated understanding of MAC-based tracking, access control evasion, and operational constraints (e.g., port security)

Evidence



This lab is documented as part of my academic training and practical skill development in cybersecurity, with emphasis on real-world tooling, command-line proficiency, and result validation.
