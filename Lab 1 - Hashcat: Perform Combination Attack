Lab: Hashcat - Perform Combination Attack
Instructor: Prof. David Vargas

This lab was completed as part of the Cybersecurity Associate Degree at Montgomery College.  
Throughout the semesters, I had the opportunity to learn from multiple instructors, and this lab represents part of the hands-on practice completed in their classes.

Lab Objective
-	perform a combination attack using Hashcat
-	analyze password cracking efficiency

What I Practiced

- Prepared the environment in Kali Linux and verified GPU/CPU support for Hashcat.
- Selected two wordlists to be combined during the attack.
- Executed a Hashcat combination attack using mode `-a 1`.
- Observed how Hashcat merges words from both lists to generate new candidate passwords.
- Analyzed the results and validated cracked hashes.


Tools Used
- Hashcat
- Kali Linux
- Virtual Box
- Terminal (bash)
